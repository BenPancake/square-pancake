<p>So do all who live to see such times <code>code element</code>, but this is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time given to us.</p>

<pre><code>import antigravity
import soul</code></pre>

<h2>H2 Element</h2>

<h3>H3 Element</h3>

<p>We used <code>code</code> to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars, now we just look down and worry about our place in the <code>code</code> dirt.</p>

<p>If you could see your entire life from start to finish, would you change things?</p>

<h2>H2 Element 2: Electric Boogaloo</h2>
